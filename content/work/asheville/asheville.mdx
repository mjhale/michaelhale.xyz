This project involved the creation of a completely new design as well as the
expansion of an existing WordPress backend. Significant changes include
location-relative suggestions as well as a revamped user flow.

Initial user tests have shown a bounce rate decrease of 25 percent and an
increase in the average time on site by 40 percent. The revamp is scheduled to go
live in 2019.
