  Brand identity and WordPress design and development project for a medical group
  practice in the Southeast.
---

Savannah Spine was a medical group practice spanning several cities across
Georgia. The group was undergoing a rapid expansion and needed a brand identity
and web presence launched within weeks of an initial consultation.

Working closely with various stakeholders and iterating quickly led to a
successful launch and enabled Savannah Spine to proceed to their additional expansion
goals.
